            <h2>Tools for Responsible Gambling:</h2>
            <p>We provide several features and tools to help you manage your gambling effectively:</p>

            <h3 class="mt-4">Self-Exclusion:</h3>
            <p>If you feel your gambling is becoming a problem, or you simply wish to take a break, you can request to self-exclude yourself from goldenstarcanada.com.</p>
            <p>Self-exclusion means that your account will be closed for a specified period (e.g., 6 months, 1 year, 5 years, or permanently), and you will not be able to log in, deposit, or play during this time. We will also remove you from our marketing lists.</p>
            <p>To initiate self-exclusion, please contact our customer support team at support@goldenstarcanada.com. Provide your account details and the desired self-exclusion period. We will process your request promptly.</p>

            <h3 class="mt-4">Deposit Limits:</h3>
            <p>You can set daily, weekly, or monthly deposit limits on your account. This helps you control the amount of money you spend on <span class="accent-keyword">golden star casino play</span> within a given timeframe.</p>
            <p>You can usually set these limits in your account settings after <span class="accent-keyword">golden star casino login</span> , or by contacting customer support.</p>
            <p>Requests to decrease a limit usually take effect immediately. Requests to increase a limit may have a waiting period to give you time to reconsider.</p>

            <h3 class="mt-4">Loss Limits:</h3>
            <p>You can set limits on the amount of money you can lose within a specific period (daily, weekly, or monthly). Once this limit is reached, you will not be able to place further bets until the next period begins.</p>
            <p>Please contact support@goldenstarcanada.com to set up loss limits.</p>

            <h3 class="mt-4">Session Limits:</h3>
            <p>You can set a maximum duration for your <span class="accent-keyword">golden star casino play</span> sessions. Once the set time has passed, you will be automatically logged out of your account.</p>
            <p>To set session limits, please contact support@goldenstarcanada.com.</p>

            <h3 class="mt-4">Reality Check:</h3>
            <p>A "Reality Check" tool can periodically pop up during your <span class="accent-keyword">golden star casino play</span> to inform you about how long you have been playing and how much you have won or lost during that session. This helps you stay aware of your activity.</p>
            <p>This feature can often be enabled or configured in your account settings or by contacting customer support.</p>

            <h2>Recognizing Problem Gambling:</h2>
            <p>It's important to be aware of the signs of problem gambling, for yourself or for someone you know. Consider these questions:</p>
            <ul class="list-unstyled">
              <li class="mb-2">Do you spend more money and time gambling than you can afford?</li>
              <li class="mb-2">Do you gamble to escape from problems or feelings of sadness?</li>
              <li class="mb-2">Do you try to win back losses with more gambling?</li>
              <li class="mb-2">Do you feel guilty or anxious about your gambling?</li>
              <li class="mb-2">Have you lied to hide the extent of your gambling?</li>
              <li class="mb-2">Has gambling negatively impacted your relationships, work, or finances?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you answered yes to several of these questions, you might be experiencing a gambling problem.</p>
